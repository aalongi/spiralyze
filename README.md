# Problem Solving with Design

1. One common problem in my work is the need to display a lot of information on one page. The challenge, of course, is to do so in a way that doesn’t overwhelm the user. Below you’ll see a small screen view of the form that uses a simple JavaScript toggle to hide information until the user selects a checkbox indicating they need the extra form elements. Then they are displayed.

2. A second problem specific to my current project is that hospitals can seem 'sterile' and uninviting. In the redesign of a Children's Hospital website one of the goals was to make the hospital break through those sterotypes and create a welcoming enviornment where parents want to bring their kids. Some of the solutions with design are:

    ### Integrating the waves found throughout the actual hospital (see pattern on floor) into the design of the site to give the site a fun and familiar feeling
